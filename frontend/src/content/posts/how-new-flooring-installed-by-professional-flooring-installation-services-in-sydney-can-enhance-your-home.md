### ****What to Look for in a Professional Flooring Installer in Sydney****

Selecting the right professional flooring installer in Sydney is a pivotal step towards achieving the perfect finish for your space. It’s crucial to ensure the team you choose has a robust reputation for delivering quality craftsmanship and outstanding customer care.

1. Start by ****asking for references********and look at online reviews**** to gauge previous customers’ experiences. This provides insight into the reliability and professionalism of the service you can expect.
2. ****Experience and qualifications****are paramount; don’t hesitate to enquire about the installer’s background in the field, especially in relation to the specific flooring type you’re interested in, be it hybrid or timber flooring. A reputable installer should be proud to share their portfolio of previous projects, showcasing the breadth and quality of their work.
3. Additionally, a professional flooring installation service should be ****fully licensed and insured****, offering peace of mind that your project is in safe hands. Confirming this not only protects you but also ensures the installer is compliant with Sydney’s regulations and standards.
4. When reaching out, pay attention to ****how responsive and helpful the service is****. This can often be a good indicator of the level of customer service you will receive throughout your flooring installation journey.

By carefully selecting a professional flooring installer, you’re laying the groundwork for a successful and satisfying upgrade to your space. At Inhaus Living, we are fully licensed and insured builders in all aspects of building construction, including the installation of new floors and the repair of old ones. Our highly experienced team will provide you with professional flooring services that you can count on to be done right the first time.

### ****Preparing Your Space for Flooring Installation****

Starting on a new flooring project is an exciting time and getting your space ready is a crucial step in the process. Here’s how to ensure your area is primed for our professional team to work their magic.

Firstly, consider the logistics of moving furniture and other large items out of the way – it’s essential for a clear and accessible workspace. If you find this daunting, don’t worry; we can assist you with advice and can lend a hand in moving those bulky pieces.

Next, focus on decluttering and removing any smaller items from the floor to provide an unobstructed canvas for installation. This is also a great opportunity to give your space a good clean, ensuring the subfloor is free from dust and debris. A clean base is paramount for a smooth installation process.

Lastly, checking that the subfloor is level and in good condition can save time and enhance the outcome. If you’re unsure about how to do this, our team is always ready to provide expert guidance and take necessary preparatory steps.

By following these simple steps, you’re not just preparing your space for new flooring; you’re setting the stage for a transformation that will breathe new life into your home.
