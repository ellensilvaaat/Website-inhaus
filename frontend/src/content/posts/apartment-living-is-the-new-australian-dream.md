That’s right, folks. The days of having a big yard and a two-storey house are over. With the ever-changing landscape of Sydney’s property market, it’s no wonder that more and **more people are choosing to live in apartments over houses**.

But when you think about it, this makes sense. When you compare your bank balance to the cost of property, you have to rethink what a “house” should look like. In fact, according to the **2015 McCrindle research**, 70 percent of Sydney residents either have lived in or currently live in an apartment, and 50 percent of people who have never lived in an apartment would consider the switch.

It’s no secret that it’s becoming harder and harder for people to get into the housing market, making it difficult for them to find affordable housing options. The next graph shows the pricing difference between apartments and houses.

But there are also other reasons why people choose apartments over houses. Some people prefer the convenience of having everything right outside their door, while others simply don’t have the time to keep maintaining their homes.

So, if you’re thinking about making the switch to an apartment, or you’re already living in one and looking for ways to upgrade your space, we’ve got good news: you don’t have to settle for an apartment with cramped spaces and no style.

Even though apartments do not have a backyard, enough storage space, or the privacy that comes with owning your own home, you can still renovate them to make the best use of space and light by adding your own personal style.

**Inhaus Living** is here to help you make the most of your space! We will turn your apartment into a gorgeous home with luxurious finishes that will make it unlike any other standard apartment. We have a wide range of luxury furniture and personalised design services that can create an interior design plan that will suit your needs perfectly.

# Benefits Of Renovating Your Apartment

The benefits of renovating your apartment are endless. It’s not just about making your place look good, it’s about making it a better place to live. Here are just a few reasons why you should renovate your apartment:

# 1. Comfort and Enjoyment

Is there anything about your current living space that makes it difficult for you to relax or unwind? Is there anything that makes it hard for you to sleep well at night? These are all things that can be easily remedied by changing up some of the elements within your home’s interior design.  When you renovate your apartment, you can make sure that everything is done just right—from the colour of the walls to the type of furniture used in each room. If there’s something about your current home that you don’t like, you can change all those things when you renovate!

# 2. Improved Functionality and Life Quality

If you have an outdated kitchen or bathroom, then you probably know how uncomfortable it can be to use them. If you’re looking for ways to improve your home’s comfort level, then renovating may be just what you need!  It can also make your life easier by reducing stressors that come with living in an outdated space (like having no storage). Some renovations will also increase efficiency in certain areas of your home (like making sure all appliances are energy-efficient).

# 3. It Makes Entertaining Better

If you like to entertain, then you probably want your home to be as attractive and inviting as possible. It’s hard to feel welcomed in a home that’s dated and old. So, if you want to really wow your guests and feel proud of your home, then renovations are a must.

# 4. It Makes Your Home More Valuable

If you want to sell your home soon, renovating it can help increase its value. Plus, with so many people interested in buying apartments these days, it’s important to consider all aspects of making your space appealing to potential buyers. And if you want to sell your apartment for more money than what you paid for it? That means renovating!

# 5. Because It’s Time to Just Do It!

If there’s something bothering you about how your apartment looks, then why not act now? You may find that renovating your home feels like an overwhelming task at first, but once you get started on it and start seeing results (like better lighting or new **flooring**), then all those worries will fade away and leave nothing but joy in their place.
