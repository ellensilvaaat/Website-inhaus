Not every home comes with a big backyard, but that does not mean your outdoor space has to be boring or overlooked. At Inhaus Living, we work with homeowners across Sydney to reimagine compact terraces, balconies, and courtyards into areas that are practical, stylish, and easy to love. 

There is something special about a well-designed small space. It feels cosy, purposeful, and just right for how people really live. And while trends come and go, a few simple principles can help you create a space that works all year round. 

So, whether you are planning a modern terrace makeover, or simply looking for new outdoor space ideas, these tips are a good place to start. 

## **Use your vertical space**

When space is tight, you need to look beyond the floor. Fences, walls, even the side of the house can be used to add visual interest and functionality. 

Wall-mounted planters, slimline trellises, or outdoor shelves are all great options. You can also use vertical elements to create privacy, especially in terrace homes where neighbours are close by. 

Climbing plants like jasmine or bougainvilleas can soften harsh lines and add greenery without losing valuable floor space. 

## **Select furniture that suits the space**

You don’t need to go custom, but you do need to be thoughtful. Choosing the right furniture for a small terrace is all about scale and flexibility. 

Look for slimline tables, benches that tuck in neatly, or foldable pieces that can be stored away when not in use. Multi-use items, like stools that can double as side tables, are ideal. 

It’s not about having less, just having the right things. Oversized lounges or bulky settings can dominate a small area, while lightweight, well-proportioned pieces help everything feel more open. 

## **Refresh the flooring**

Flooring sets the tone for the whole space. If your terrace feels cold or unfinished, updating the surface could be all it needs. 

There are plenty of cost-effective ways to lift tired areas. Think timber-look deck tiles, outdoor rugs, or even a coat of textured exterior paint. In sunnier spots, lighter tones tend to reflect heat and make things feel more spacious. 

And if you are incorporating a terrace into a new build or renovation, speak to your builder or designer early. The right flooring can tie indoor and outdoor areas together beautifully. 

## **Make lighting a priority**

It is easy to focus on furniture and finishes, but lighting is what brings everything to life. Especially in the evening. 

Soft wall lights, battery-operated lanterns, or festoon lights strung overhead all help create a warm, inviting atmosphere. A layered approach works best. Use practical lighting for safety and ambient options for mood. 

One well-placed light can completely change how a small terrace feels after dark. We help clients plan lighting early in the design process, so it complements their layout and use of space. 

## **Keep plants simple but intentional**

Greenery adds softness, privacy, and a sense of calm. But more is not always better in a small area. 

Rather than crowding the space with dozens of pots, start with one or two larger feature plants. Add a few smaller ones to fill out the corners, and stick with hardy varieties suited to the climate. 

We like using plants to define zones or frame seating areas. Even a single tall tree in a large pot can give structure and shade, without cluttering the area. 

## **Define different zones**

Even the smallest terrace can feel more functional when it is zoned properly. A change in rug texture, a shift in plant placement, or simply facing your chairs inwards can help create separate areas for dining, lounging, or reading. 

It might seem counterintuitive to divide an already small space, but it actually helps it feel larger. Thoughtful layout makes all the difference, especially in homes where the terrace is an extension of the main living area. 

## **Keep styling relaxed**

The best outdoor spaces are the ones people actually use. That means choosing pieces that are comfortable, weather-appropriate, and not too precious. 

Avoid the temptation to over-style. You do not need endless cushions, trays, or decor to make a space feel welcoming. A few quality pieces in natural tones, combined with greenery and soft lighting, is usually enough. 

Outdoor areas should feel like a part of your home, not a showroom. Slight imperfections are fine. Real life is meant to happen out there.
