## Set a realistic budget and timeline

Now that you know they why, it can become very exciting to get the mood board out and start planning. However, before things get too carried away, it’s important to discuss your budget and timeline.

Allocating a realistic budget, with a contingency buffer for the unexpected, towards your project. You don’t want to get halfway through your renovation and be watching the pennies because the budget wasn’t realistic.

Similarly, when you are creating the timeline for your project, try to be flexible. Delays can occur and renovations can fall behind schedule. If you have a deadline in stone, we recommend implementing a time buffer as well. This will assist in mitigating any potential delays and if you are fortunate, you may be cooking in your new kitchen sooner than you thought.

## Choose the right renovation professionals for your project

With so many builders and companies advertising kitchen renovations in Sydney, how do you choose the right renovation partner for you?

The heart of your home deserves the expertise of professionals who can turn your dreams into reality. From a quality architect who can draw up the plans to a builder and cabinet maker who can bring your dream kitchen to life, now is the time to do your research. Investigate the past projects of your potential candidates and have open discussions with them about your budget and timeline.

## Design your dream kitchen with care

The next stage is one most of our clients really enjoy – the design phase. This is where you can start to get creative. Grab your mood board and start having debates with your significant other about materials, colours and layout.

The layout and functionality of your kitchen are paramount to its overall usability. Consider how you use the space and identify any inefficiencies or areas that need improvement. If you’re using a designer, work with them to create a layout that maximises space, promotes efficiency, and enhances workflow. Think about the placement of appliances, storage solutions, and the flow of traffic within the kitchen.

Remember, every decision from the layout to the smallest fitting plays a crucial role in creating a kitchen that’s not just visually appealing but also fits into your daily life.

## Navigating Sydney’s building codes and regulations

Every kitchen renovation needs to adhere to Sydney’s local building codes and regulations. Understanding what’s allowed and not allowed, or ensuring your renovation partner is knowledgeable about what’s required will ensure that your kitchen renovation runs smoothly and passes any certifications/approvals that are needed.

This step, although seemingly bureaucratic, is a vital part of your renovation journey. It ensures your new kitchen not only dazzles in design but also aligns with Sydney’s building codes and safety standards.
