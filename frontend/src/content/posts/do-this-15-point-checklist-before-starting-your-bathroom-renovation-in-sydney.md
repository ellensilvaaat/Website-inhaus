## 1. **Make sure you have a plan**

**Before you start your bathroom renovation**, make sure that you have a clear idea of what kind of look and feel you want for your space. What will the layout look like? How much storage do you need? What kind of features can be installed?

Before you start your bathroom renovation, make sure to have a clear plan of what you want to do with the space. This will help guide your decision-making process and ensure that your renovation is successful.

## # Know your budget

When it comes to renovations, there’s no such thing as “quick and easy.” You should have a clear understanding of how much money you can afford to spend on the project in order to avoid any surprises later.

Setting a budget will help guide you as you make decisions about what to include in the remodel. Once you’ve figured out what you can spend and subtracted the amount allocated to labour, you’ll have a clearer sense of what you can spend on tile, fixtures, and extras.

## # How much time do you have

Create a timeline for the project so that it fits into your schedule without causing too much trouble for yourself or anyone else involved with the project. You should also include times when each contractor can come over.

However, planning refers not only to defining the duration of the renovation works but also certain intermediate steps such as ordering and purchasing tiles, fixtures, custom-built vanity, or cabinets to make sure they can be delivered when your contractor needs them.

## # The type of renovation that will suit your needs

Is it a full renovation or just a few cosmetic changes? A complete overhaul of the entire room will be more costly than just changing the color scheme or adding a new fixture, but both options come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages.

## # Get an expert opinion

If you’re looking for an expert opinion on whether your bathroom needs renovating, it’s always best to ask someone who has knowledge of the job and has done similar projects before. They will be able to give you an idea of what needs doing and how much it will cost.

## # What materials will be used

There are many different types of material available on today’s market, including stone tiles, glass tiles, wood floors and more! Each material has its own pros and cons which should be considered before making any decisions about what kind of material will best suit your needs.

This will depend on what kind of bathroom you’d like to create—if it’s just a simple remodel then all kinds of materials are available at any home improvement store in Sydney; if it’s something more complicated than you might need professional help from an expert contractor who has experience working with these types of projects before.

## # Choose a contractor

Once you know what needs doing, it’s time to find someone who can help get it done! If possible, try and find someone who has experience with bathrooms specifically so they know exactly what they’re doing when working in this area – otherwise, it could take longer than necessary with lots of mistakes along the way!

## # Make sure everything is up to date

When you’re renovating your bathroom, it’s important to make sure everything is in good working condition so that you can avoid any potential problems during the renovation process.

Is your ceiling still in good shape? Have you had any leaks lately? Is there mould on the walls? If not, now is a great time to get it all checked out!

Is the water heater still working well? It’s important to have an adequate supply of hot water for your shower and sink, so make sure that it can do its job without breaking down on you too soon.

And don’t forget about your heating system! Make sure it isn’t leaking water into the room below, or else it’ll leak into your basement or crawl space too.

## # Design, style, and functionality

During your bathroom renovation, it’s important to keep in mind how you want the space to look as well as how it will function. Do you want a more modern look with sleek lines and minimalistic features? Or do you prefer a more traditional look with ornate details and classic colours? Once you’ve decided on a style for your space, you can start thinking about what elements will be most important to include in your design.

## # Plumbing fixtures and features

Once you’ve decided on your design, it’s time to think about what kind of plumbing fixtures and features will work best with your new look.

Consider what kind of plumbing fixtures you’d like in your bathroom—shower/tub combo? Bidet? Sink with faucet? Consider how much water pressure you’ll need to wash yourself effectively with each fixture, as well as how much space there is to install them. You may also want to consider adding features like an exhaust fan or venting system if there aren’t already enough outlets installed in the area where they would go most usefully.

## # Cabinets, storage, and shelving

If there’s one thing every homeowner needs in their home bathroom, it’s storage space! A good cabinet system can help keep things tidy while also making them easy-to-access when they’re needed most (like when someone is getting ready for work).

Once we know what type of design we’re going for (and how much space we have), we’ll figure out how much storage is needed in each room (including medicine cabinets). From there, we’ll help you choose between different kinds of cabinetry options like shaker style cabinets with glass fronts or wood shelves. There are so many possibilities out there!

## # Decide what kind of flooring you want

When it comes to choosing a **flooring option** for your bathroom renovations, there are a lot of options available. It can be difficult to know which one is right for you until you do some research and find out what works best for your home décor and personal preferences.

For example, if you’re going with tile, then choose an option like Porcelain Tile Flooring that has a unique pattern or design running throughout each square inch of tile, so it doesn’t look bland when combined with other types of tiles in different colours/designs/shapes etc.

## # Lighting

Lighting is one of the biggest factors in making a room look finished and complete, so be sure to consider what kind of lighting you want to add before you start renovation. If possible, focus on natural light, whereas artificial light is advisable if you have at least 4 watts of incandescent lighting per square foot.

A well-lit bathroom is essential for safety reasons, but also for aesthetics! Think about where your light sources will be coming from—whether it’s overhead lights or lamps on vanity tables—and how many bulbs will be needed for each area (i.e., if there are two sinks).

## # Accessories

Accessories can make or break a space, so don’t forget to include them in your planning process. You can change up things like shower curtains or towels for something new without having to do anything else about the room itself – which makes them perfect for those who want their renovation projects done quickly but still want something different from what was there before.

You’ll want to buy accessories that go well with your new design scheme. If it’s traditional, then look for traditional accessories; if it’s modern, then look for modern ones. You can even mix and match if you’d like!

## # Ventilation

We all know how important ventilation is when it comes to keeping our homes healthy and clean – but did you know that it can also improve the look of your bathroom?

Ventilation is crucial in any room where water is used frequently, and this includes showers and bathtubs. If you’re going to be installing a waterfall shower hear or whirlpool tub in your new bathroom, make sure that there’s plenty of ventilation available so that no water can get trapped under these items and cause mould growth (which is not good).
