### # Pre-Planning Phase

This is the initial stage of the project where you’ll lay the groundwork for the renovation. During this phase, you’ll conduct research, identify your goals, and develop a preliminary budget. Here’s what you can expect during the pre-planning phase of a bathroom renovation:

#### **Assessing your needs and goals**

*This will take 1 to 3 weeks.*

The first step in the pre-planning phase is to assess your needs and goals for the bathroom renovation. What problems are you trying to solve? Do you want to increase storage space, improve functionality, or update the look of the bathroom? Identifying your goals will help you develop a plan of action.

#### **Establishing a budget**

Once you’ve identified your goals, you’ll need to consider the **costs of bathroom renovation**. Determine how much you can afford to spend on the renovation and how much you should allocate to each aspect of the project.

#### **Researching design options**

The pre-planning phase is an excellent opportunity to research design options and get inspiration for your renovation. Look at magazines, websites, and blogs for ideas, and create a Pinterest board to save your favourite images.

#### **Securing permits and approvals**

*This process can take up to 4 weeks, depending on your location and the complexity of the project.*

After you have finalised the design plan, you may need council approval. For apartments, you’ll also need to consider the **rules for renovating under strata**.

### # Choosing and sourcing materials and fixtures

*This process typically takes 1 to 2 weeks.*

Once you have secured the necessary permits and approvals, you can begin choosing and sourcing materials and fixtures. This will involve selecting items such as tiles, lighting, and bathroom accessories. Consider the durability, maintenance requirements, and cost of each option.

Luckily, **Inhaus Living** partners with **trusted brands and reliable suppliers** of affordable quality products.

### # Construction Phase

The construction phase of bathroom renovation is the most crucial part of the process. This is where the design comes to life, and you begin seeing your vision for your bathroom take shape.

Here’s the breakdown of what you can expect to happen during construction:

#### **Demolition (if necessary)**

*This process typically takes 1 to 2 days, depending on the size of the bathroom and the extent of the demolition required.*

This step involves removing any existing fixtures, tiles, and fittings from the bathroom. If any walls or floors need to be removed, this will also be done during the demolition phase.

#### **Redoing plumbing and electricals (if necessary)**

*This process typically takes 1 to 4 days, depending on the complexity of the work required.*

If the bathroom’s plumbing or electrical systems need to be updated or repaired, this will be done during this phase. This may involve installing new pipes, rewiring electricals, or relocating fixtures.

#### **Waterproofing and installing floor and wall tiles (if necessary)**

*This process can take up to a week, depending on the size of the bathroom and the type of tiles being used.*

Once the plumbing and electricals are taken care of, the bathroom will be waterproof to prevent any water damage. Then, new tiles will be installed on both the floor and walls.

#### **Fittings and fixtures**

*This process typically takes 1 to 3 days, depending on the number of fixtures being installed.*

The final step in the construction phase is to install any fittings and fixtures, such as the toilet, sink, bathtub, and shower.

It is important to work with a professional contractor to ensure that the construction phase is completed safely, efficiently, and to a high standard.

### # Post-Construction Phase

After the construction phase of bathroom renovation is complete, there is still work to be done to ensure that the bathroom is fully functional and ready for use. The post-construction phase typically involves the following steps:

#### **Cleaning and Inspection**

*This step can only take 1 day.*

Once the construction work is complete, the bathroom will need to be thoroughly cleaned to remove any dust, debris, or construction materials that may have accumulated during the renovation process. This may involve deep cleaning the tiles and grout, wiping down fixtures and fittings, and vacuuming or sweeping the floors.

After the bathroom has been cleaned, it’s important to conduct a thorough inspection to ensure that everything is in working order. This may involve checking the plumbing and electrical systems, ensuring that all fixtures are properly installed, and making sure that there are no leaks or other issues that could cause problems down the line.

#### **Final walkthrough**

*The process will only take 30 minutes.*

Before the renovation is officially complete, it’s a good idea to do a final walkthrough to make sure that everything is up to the homeowner’s satisfaction. This is a chance to identify any remaining issues or concerns, and to make sure that the bathroom is fully functional and ready for use.

This is a critical step in ensuring that the renovation is successful, and that the new bathroom meets the homeowner’s expectations. By taking the time to clean, inspect, and add the finishing touches, homeowners can enjoy their newly renovated bathroom for years to come.
