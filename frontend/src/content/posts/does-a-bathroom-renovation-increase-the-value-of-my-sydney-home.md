At **Inhaus Living**, one of the main questions we get asked by clients is **does a bathroom renovation increase the value of my Sydney home?** Of course, our answer is yes, but you can’t just dive in and start choosing tile colours and towel choices.

Deciding to start a bathroom renovation takes time and money. That’s why we’re going to explore how a bathroom renovation can lift the value of your Sydney home but also what you need to keep in mind along the way.

As one of the most expensive property markets in the country, your Sydney home has untapped potential that could translate into dollars at sale time, let alone transform the way you live.

The common phrase, kitchens and bathrooms sell houses, especially in the Sydney property market. Even a minor update to your bathroom could potentially add value to your property, in an already saturated market. If you are fortunate enough to own your own home or looking to purchase your first home, a **bathroom renovations in Sydney** is less expensive than knocking down and rebuilding an entire house. You might have a dated bathroom, but there are ways to renovate your bathroom affordably regardless of your budget. At Inhaus Living, we specialise in helping our clients renovate their bathrooms and making every dollar spent translate into extra value into their homes.

## ****Emotional vs Financial investment – Striking the balance****

With any **bathroom renovation in Sydney**, there is always a battle between the heart and the wallet and it can be difficult to strike the balance. Now that you’ve made the decision to renovate, you’ve probably flicked through the pages of **Vogue Living** to see what the latest trends are and your pinterest board is covered in ideas of how you can incorporate them into your new bathroom.

However, amidst all the excitement of selecting tiles and fixtures that would make this bathroom your escape from everyday life, lies the reality of the budget. It’s essential to pause, reflect, and make sure that your **bathroom remodel** is going to align with your long term property goals. Some of the key questions you could ask yourself include:

- Is this your forever home?
- Is there a way to achieve your desired look in another way?
- Is this renovation to improve your lifestyle or is it to help to sell your property?
- How long will this renovation last in line with current design trends?

It can be difficult not to get caught up in the excitement of the renovation. We understand that you want the bathroom of your dreams, and our team are here to work with you to help achieve the look and feel you’re wanting within your budget. After all it’s about affordable luxury.

## ****Key considerations before starting your bathroom renovation****

Even with all the excitement of a bathroom renovation and how it will transform your home, there are some key considerations you need to think about before construction begins.

- ****Set a realistic budget:****The budget needs to reflect your financial circumstances as well as be able to achieve your aspirations for the space. Make sure to include a contingency fund for any unexpected expenses.
- ****Be design conscious:****Find a timeless design that resonates with your personal style but can also appeal to a broader market if you decide to sell. You don’t want to renovate now and then hate the design in three years.
- ****Analyse several times before finalising the layout:****Renovating allows you to move things around to be more functional. However, if you change your mind hallway through it will be expensive. So, analyse the floorplan several times before finalising the layout.
- ****Question your choices and be creative:****When it comes to features like heated **Sydney flooring**, ask yourself **will that really add extra value to your Sydney home?** Is there a way to achieve the look you want on a slightly smaller, more affordable budget? Get the creative juices flowing and see what you can come up with.

## ****Finding a renovation supplier****

Unless you know how to renovate yourself or have a family member or friend to help you out, you are going to need an expert to help you at least the planning and construction. When searching for renovation partner, it’s important to find a supplier that not only shares your vision but has the experience to bring it to life. They need to be able to listen to you and alleviate any concerns that you have along the way.

Seek out professionals who are not just skilled craftsmen but are also passionate about creating spaces that reflect their client’s individuality. Ask questions, set guidelines, look at their past projects and ask for references. You’re investing not only in your house, but in your home so you need to be comfortable with your decision.
