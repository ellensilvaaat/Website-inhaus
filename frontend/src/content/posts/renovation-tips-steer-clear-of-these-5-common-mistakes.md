Are you considering a home renovation project? Before you dive headfirst into the world of renovations, it’s important to arm yourself with the right information and tools to ensure a successful outcome.

At **Inhaus Living**, we have witnessed lots of renovations with some of our clients coming to us after experiencing some of the most common renovation mistakes. In this article, we will discuss the 5 most common renovation mistakes and provide you with tips on how to avoid them. From proper renovation planning to seeking professional advice, we’ve got you covered with all the smart renovation tricks you need to know.

## Skipping the Planning Phase

Starting on a renovation without a solid plan is akin to setting sail without a map. It’s a journey that’s likely to encounter unexpected challenges and costs. To steer clear of such pitfalls, it’s imperative to immerse yourself in the planning phase with gusto.

Begin by envisioning the final look of your renovation but don’t stop there. Detail every aspect, from design preferences to material selections, ensuring you have a comprehensive blueprint of your project. This meticulous approach not only anchors your budget firmly in reality but also sets a realistic timeline, helping to manage expectations from the start.

Planning also allows you to identify potential obstacles early on, providing ample time to devise solutions. This stage is your opportunity to dream big, then distil those dreams into a feasible, detailed plan of action. Embrace the planning phase with enthusiasm, for it is the foundation upon which the success of your renovation project is built.

## Underestimating Costs

A frequent mistake in the world of home renovations is not giving enough consideration to the financial aspect, resulting in budget overruns and unnecessary stress. To avoid this pitfall, it’s essential to begin with a clear-eyed assessment of the total investment your project will require.

Request detailed quotes from several reputable contractors to ensure a range of perspectives and prices. Remember, the lowest quote may not always be the best option if it compromises quality. Including a contingency fund in your budget is a wise move, as it prepares you for unforeseen expenses that inevitably arise during renovations. This foresight not only protects your finances but also instills a sense of security and control in your renovation journey.

By taking these steps, you are not only preparing for the costs you expect but also those you don’t, ensuring your project stays on track without breaking the bank.

## Ignoring Professional Advice

Diving into a renovation project with a DIY spirit can be incredibly rewarding, but there’s a fine line between being hands-on and flying solo without a safety net. Seeking out professional advice isn’t just a step in the renovation process; it’s a savvy strategy to ensure your project’s success. Experts in the field, whether they be seasoned contractors, skilled designers, or specialist architects, bring a wealth of knowledge and insight that can prove invaluable. Their guidance can help you navigate the complex maze of renovation decisions, from selecting the right materials that marry durability with aesthetics, to optimising your layout for both flow and function.

Professionals are adept at spotting potential issues that might not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye, thus averting costly and time-consuming corrections down the line. Their experience also means they’re well-versed in the latest trends and can offer creative solutions to help your renovation stand out. They can also provide a realistic overview of what’s achievable within your budget, helping to manage your expectations and prevent any financial surprises.

In essence, incorporating professional advice, including from the team at Inhaus Living, into your renovation journey enriches the process, blending your personal vision with expert precision. This collaboration not only elevates the quality of your renovation project but also ensures that the journey to transforming your home is as smooth and stress-free as possible.

## Overlooking Permits and Regulations

Navigating the maze of permits and regulations might seem daunting, but it’s a crucial step in the renovation process that should not be ignored. The importance of obtaining the necessary permits and ensuring your project complies with local building codes cannot be overstated. Falling foul of these regulations can bring about a host of problems, from costly fines to significant delays, and may even necessitate the reversal of work already carried out.

Initiating your project by engaging with your local council or planning authority is a wise move. They can provide detailed guidance on the specific permits required for your renovation, based on its scope and location. This preliminary step is not just about ticking boxes; it’s an investment in the smooth progression and completion of your project.

Remember, each area might have its unique set of rules and regulations, so what applied to a friend’s renovation in another city might not hold for yours. Taking the time to understand and adhere to these guidelines ensures your renovation journey is not just legally compliant, but also more predictable and less stressful.

By incorporating this essential task into your renovation planning, you’re safeguarding your project against potential setbacks, ensuring it progresses as smoothly and efficiently as possible. This approach reflects a well-informed, proactive stance towards renovation, setting the stage for a successful transformation of your home.

## Sacrificing Function for Form

One of the cardinal mistakes in renovating is prioritising aesthetics over practicality. Whilst achieving a stunning visual outcome is undoubtedly desirable, it’s paramount to remember that your home needs to cater to your daily lifestyle. During the planning stages, thoughtful consideration should be given to how each space will be utilised. For instance, beautiful, sleek surfaces in a kitchen are appealing, but if they’re prone to scratches or require high maintenance, they may not be the best choice for a bustling family home. Similarly, opting for fashionable but uncomfortable furniture can detract from the enjoyment and functionality of your living areas. It’s about striking a balance; make design decisions that not only elevate your home’s beauty but also enhance its liveability.

Integrating smart storage solutions, selecting durable materials, and arranging rooms in a way that flows with your routines can transform your space into one that’s as functional as it is visually appealing. Remember, the ultimate goal is to create a home that serves as a sanctuary, harmonising style with everyday practicality.
