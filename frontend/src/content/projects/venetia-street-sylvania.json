This balance ensured the home remained timeless yet meeting the demands of a contemporary family.\n\nInhaus Living’s design approach focused on enhancing existing features while seamlessly integrating modern elements for a balanced, thoughtful transformation.\n\nOpen plan living\nOne of the main focuses was on opening the living spaces, by creating a more fluid layout. The home now enjoys maximised natural light and improved connectivity between indoor and outdoor areas. This change not only enhances the visual appeal but also promotes a sense of spaciousness and ease of movement throughout the home.\n\nHigh-quality materials and finishes\nFixtures and finishes were carefully selected to reflect the owners design vision. High-quality materials ensure durability and longevity, while elegant finishes added a touch of luxury to everyday living. The combination of these elements results in a home that is beautiful as it is practical.\n\nPreserving Architectural Integrity\nWhile modern updates were added, the renovation kept the home’s original style intact. This way, it still has its unique character and charm, while feeling fresh and up to date.\n\nThe Venetia St renovation blends timeless charm with modern living.
