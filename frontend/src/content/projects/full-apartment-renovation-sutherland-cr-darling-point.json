  "content": "The clients, a professional couple, approached Inhaus Living with a clear vision: They wanted a modern, low maintenance living space, making the most of the apartments stunning natural outlook. They wanted to create an easy to maintain space that didn’t compromise on style, creating a home that feels calm, refined and ready to enjoy.\n\nWe designed the apartment to make the most of its natural light and views, while making sure every room felt thoughtful and inviting.\n\nOpen Plan Living: We reconfigured the layout to allow for open plan living, creating uninterrupted sightlines across the apartment and out to the harbour. This not only improved the sense of space but enhanced natural ventilation and light throughout.\n\nTimeless Natural Palette & Warm Timber Flooring: To achieve a serene, welcoming atmosphere, we opted for a neutral colour palette paired with rich timber flooring. The warm tones softened the space and provided a sophisticated, grounded element to the overall design.\n\nUser-Friendly, Sleek Kitchen: The kitchen was redesigned with a sleek minimalist aesthetic. Integrated appliances, clean joinery lines, and clever storage solutions make it both functional and visually streamlined – ideal for cooking, entertaining or simply relaxing.\n\nSpa-Inspired Bathroom: The bathroom was transformed into a tranquil retreat. Featuring a freestanding tub, walk-in shower, and a spacious accessible layout, it mirrors the look and feel of a boutique hotel – while remaining highly practical for daily use.\n\nThe finished apartment is bright, peaceful, and calm. Every design choice was made to keep things simple, stylish, and easy to live in. The result is a space that feels both elegant and comfortable, exactly what the clients were hoping for.\n\nMake an enquiry today with Inhaus Living.\n\nHomes | Apartments | Kitchens | Bathrooms | Flooring | Construction\n\nShop 10/2A Todman Ave,\nKensington NSW 2033,\nAustralia\n\nThis website is proudly powered by the passionate team at ALEPH IT.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."
