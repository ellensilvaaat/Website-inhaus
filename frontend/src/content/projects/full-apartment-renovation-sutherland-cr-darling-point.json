  "content": "This full apartment renovation in Darling Point was designed for a professional couple seeking a modern, low-maintenance home that would fully embrace its elevated natural outlook. The brief focused on creating a calm and refined interior that feels effortless to live in, without compromising on quality, comfort or visual clarity. The design approach prioritised light, openness and connection to the surrounding environment. By reconfiguring the layout to support open-plan living, the apartment now benefits from uninterrupted sightlines that extend through the interior and out towards the harbour. This adjustment not only enhances the perception of space but also improves natural ventilation and daylight penetration throughout the home. A timeless, neutral palette was paired with warm timber flooring to establish a sense of balance and softness. The restrained material selection allows the views to remain the focal point, while grounding the interior with warmth and understated elegance. The kitchen was redesigned with a clean, minimalist aesthetic, focusing on usability and visual simplicity. Integrated appliances, streamlined joinery and well-considered storage solutions create a highly functional space that supports both everyday living and entertaining, while remaining discreet and refined. In the bathroom, the design draws on spa-inspired principles to create a tranquil retreat. A freestanding bathtub and walk-in shower are set within a generous, accessible layout, evoking the comfort of a boutique hotel while remaining practical for daily use. Soft finishes and thoughtful detailing reinforce the sense of calm and refinement. The completed renovation delivers a bright, peaceful and cohesive apartment where every design decision contributes to ease of living. Sutherland Crescent reflects Inhaus Living’s approach to full apartment renovation — thoughtful planning, restrained materiality and spaces designed to feel both elegant and comfortable over time."
