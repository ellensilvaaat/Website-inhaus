  "content": "This bathroom and kitchen renovation in Darling Point was designed for a young professional seeking to update an ageing apartment with spaces that are contemporary, functional and easy to maintain. The brief focused on creating two highly considered environments that would support a busy lifestyle while maintaining a refined and timeless aesthetic. The design approach centred on clarity, balance and usability. Rather than introducing unnecessary complexity, the renovation prioritised clean lines, well-resolved layouts and material selections that enhance both durability and visual calm. The result is a pair of spaces that feel cohesive, practical and distinctly modern. In the bathroom, a soft neutral palette establishes a serene and welcoming atmosphere. Textured tiles were introduced as a feature element behind the shower, adding depth and tactility while maintaining a restrained overall composition. Minimalist detailing, uncluttered surfaces and carefully selected fixtures contribute to a space that feels open, balanced and effortless to use on a daily basis. The kitchen was conceived as a light-filled and highly functional hub, defined by an all-white palette that enhances brightness and a sense of openness. Marble-look surfaces with subtle grey veining were used for the splashback and waterfall island benchtop, introducing visual interest while preserving a cohesive, understated aesthetic. Integrated appliances were seamlessly incorporated into the joinery, reinforcing a streamlined appearance and supporting everyday functionality. Layout planning played a key role in the success of the kitchen design. The arrangement of work zones and storage was carefully considered to support efficient movement and ease of use, ensuring the space performs as well as it presents. Together, the kitchen and bathroom renovations significantly enhance the apartment’s sense of flow, light and spatial clarity. The completed project delivers a refined yet practical outcome, reflecting Inhaus Living’s approach to renovation — thoughtful design, purposeful material selection and spaces that are tailored to modern living."
